Detailed Module Descriptions:

1. pgmReadFromFile
This is a small module that will be used by all of the core programs when 
they want to read from a file. It takes a pgm struct and a filename.
This will create the file pointer and then pass this pointer to pgmReader, 
I chose to separate this module from the reader module so that the reader 
module can take any type of stream pointer not just a file pointer.

2. pgmReader
This module takes a pgm struct and a stream pointer to (hopefully) a pgm 
file, it will verify that this is indeed a pgm file, will find out what
type of file it is, and populate the given struct with information
about the pgm as well as it's image data.

3. pgmWriteToFile
This is similar to readFromFile, it takes a pgm struct and a filename, and
creates a file pointer to that file if it is writable and exits, it then 
passes this to pgmWriter

4. pgmWriter
This is a module that takes a pgm struct and a stream pointer and attempts
to output the data from the pgm struct into a pgm file.

5. pgmEcho
This uses pgmReadFromFile and pgmWriteToFile to read a given input pgm, and 
copy it to a given output pgm.

6. pgmComp
This uses pgmReadFromFile to get the data of two given pgm images and then 
determines whether they are logically equivalent, this means whether or not
they will create the same image, not necessarily if they have the same code.

7. converter 
Converter is used by both pgma2b and pgmb2a, it takes a filname, and a format
and it will attempt to, if that file is not already that format, to convert
it to that format and output it to a given output file. It will use 
pgmReadFromFile and pgmWriteToFile to achieve this.

8. pgma2b
Very simple module that takes an input file and output file, and passes them
to converter with character 'R' to tell converter that the input image should
be converted to a binary (RAW) file.

9. pgmb2a
Very simple module that takes an input file and output file, and passes them
to converter with character 'P' to tell converter that the input image should
be converted to a ASCII (PLAIN) file.
 
10. pgmReduce
This program takes an input image, a reduction factor and an output image and
then tries to reduce the input image by the given reduction factor, and putting
this reduced image in the ouput file. It reduces the image by only including
the pixles in the input image such that pixel's row % reduction factor == 0 and
pixel's height % reduction factor == 0.

11. pgmTile
This program takes an input image, reduction factor, and output image template, 
and splits the input image into (reduction factor)^2 output images in the given
template format. It will emoloy an algorithm that attempts to make the output 
tiles as evenly sized as possible.

12. pgmAssemble
This program takes an output filename, width and height, and then a number of 
tiles which it will join together to form the output image.

13. exitMessages
This module takes an exit code, and will putput an apropriate message and then 
return one of the standard error codes. For example it would take code 101 which
represents a miscellaneous malloc error, print a relevant message and then return
100 as it is a miscellaneous error.

14. roundNumber
Simple utility which will round a double to the nearest whole number. Used in tile.

15. sqrtNumber 
Simple utility which will sqrt a given square number. Used in assemble.

16. checkInt
Simple utility which will check if a given number is an integer.
