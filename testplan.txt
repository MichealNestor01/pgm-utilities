This is my test plan for assignment_1
===========================================================================
Test Plan:

All of my tests will be implemented using bash scripts in a .sh file.

Error Detection Testing:
I will test each program using pgm images that have been altered by me
in someway such that they violate the pgm specification. The bash script
will detect whether or not a program can detect that a pgm file does not 
meet the specification and whether or not it returns the correct error 
code and error message. Another type of file that will be tested are 
non writable files, I will use chmod to remove write permisions from 
some files, and then test to see how the programs respond to being told 
to write to them.

Functionality Testing:
I will also test each programs functionality, whether it carries out the 
function it was designed for correctly. An example of this kind of test 
would be me creating a custom pgm file and then tiling it by hand, then
using the bash script to see if pgmTile creates all of the same tiles 
when given the correct parameters.
